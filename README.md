This is by far my favorite  game Ive ever made .Its sample.
It makes a random number and you have four crystals,each crystal has a value you cant see the value till you click it .
you need to match the number i gave you if you = it you win and if you go over you loose sorry for you .
Bewarn the crystal value change every round.
