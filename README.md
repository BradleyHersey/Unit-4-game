<strong>How to Play</strong>
A random number is generated on the page.<br>
Four gems are also displayed as buttons, each with a different hidden value.<br>
Each time the player clicks on a button, that hidden value is added to their total score.<br>
If the player matches their score to the random number, they win the game!<br>
When the game is restarted, a new random number and new gem values are assigned.<br>
